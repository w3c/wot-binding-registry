      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        W3C Web of Things (WoT) enables applications to interact with and orchestrate connected Things at the Web scale.
        The standardized abstract interaction model exposed by the WoT Thing Description enables applications to scale
        and evolve independently of the individual Things. Through WoT Bindings, the abstract interactions can be bound
        to various network-level protocols, standards, and platforms for connected Things, which already have have
        millions of devices deployed in the field today. This is done through protocol-specific URI schemes, additional
        descriptive vocabularies, and examples that guide the implementors of WoT Things and Consumers alike.
      </p>
      <p>
        This document defines a registry of WoT bindings that make it possible to have a record of the different
        bindings. Additionally, it sets the rules that govern this registry to guarantee a quality standard, long
        lifecycle and ease of use for the developers.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        The Web of Things (WoT) has the goal of improving interoperability in IoT and enabling the integration of
        various IoT ecosystems and communities. While the [[WOT-THING-DESCRIPTION11]] defines the abstract operations
        and interaction affordances, bindings map these to concrete network messages. Thus, thanks to bindings, the W3C
        Web of Things support multiple protocols and media types in a descriptive approach by adding further information
        to Thing Descriptions.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the number of such protocols and media types is vast and tends to change over time, this document defines a
        flexible mechanism called a Binding Registry. This document relies on the registry track mechanism of the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#registries">W3C Process</a> and extends it to be specific and fit
        to the purposes of WoT bindings.
      </p>

      <p>
        This enables a binding to be written by people with a good understanding of the binding, who are not necessarily
        participants of the WoT Working Group, such as other organizations developing a standard that can be used with
        WoT. This also allows the WoT Working Group to focus on the core specifications and engage other communities at
        the same time.

          <h3>Technical submission mechanism</h3>
          <p>The mechanism is as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We work with issues only. The information for the entry format is submitted as a list. This way, non-W3C
              members can submit a binding. Reviews from the custodian happen on the issue. The submitter is expected to
              answer until the custodian makes a PR to add the binding to the registry or change its status.
            </li>
            <li>
              A purpose built GitHub project for tracking submissions is used. When a submission comes in form an issue,
              it is automatically added to column &quot;Binding Submitted&quot;. When the <a>custodian</a> and
              <a>reviewers</a> start looking at it, it goes to the &quot;Under Review&quot; column. If the review is in
              favor, the custodian makes the PR to add it to the registry and the issue goes to column
              &quot;Accepted&quot;. If the review is not in favor, it goes to the column &quot;Rejected&quot;. All these
              changes are reflected as comments in the original issue.

            associated with one or more known TD specification versions.
