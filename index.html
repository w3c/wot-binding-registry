      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>
        W3C Web of Things (WoT) enables applications to interact with and orchestrate connected Things at the Web scale.
        The standardized abstract interaction model exposed by the WoT Thing Description enables applications to
        scale and evolve independently of the individual Things.
        Through WoT Bindings, the abstract interactions can be bound to various network-level protocols, standards,
        and platforms for connected Things, which already have have millions of devices deployed in the field today. 
        This is done through protocol-specific URI schemes, additional descriptive vocabularies, and examples that 
        guide the implementors of WoT Things and Consumers alike.
      </p>
      <p>
        This document defines a registry of WoT bindings that make it possible to have a record of the different bindings. 
        Additionally, it sets the rules that govern this registry to guarantee a quality standard, long lifecycle and ease 
        of use for the developers.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      
      <p>
        The Web of Things (WoT) has the goal of improving interoperability in IoT and enabling the integration of various IoT ecosystems and communities.
        While the [[WOT-THING-DESCRIPTION11]] defines the abstract operations and interaction affordances, bindings map these to concrete network messages.
        Thus, thanks to bindings, the W3C Web of Things support multiple protocols and media types in a descriptive approach by adding further information to Thing Descriptions.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the number of such protocols and media types is vast and tends to change over time, this document defines a flexible mechanism called a Bindings Registry.
        This document relies on the registry track mechanism of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#registries">W3C Process</a> and extends it to be specific and fit to the purposes of WoT bindings.

            <p>Technical submission mechanism. How does a binding get submitted?</p>
            <ul>
              <li>We work with issues only. The information for the entry format is submitted as a list. This way, non-W3C members can submit a binding. Reviews from the custodian happen on the issue. The submitter is expected to answer until the custodian makes a PR to add the binding to the registry or change its status.</li>
              <li>A purpose built GitHub project for tracking submissions is used. When a submission comes in form an issue, it is automatically added to column &quot;Binding Submitted&quot;. When the custodian and reviewers start looking at it, it goes to the &quot;Under Review&quot; column. If the review is in favour, the custodian makes the PR to add it to the registry and the issue goes to column &quot;Accepted&quot;. If the review is not in favour, it goes to the column &quot;Rejected&quot;. All these changes are reflected as comments in the original issue.</li>
              <li>If a new entry conflicts with another entry, the reviewer MUST mark the new submission accordingly. As two bindings that do the same are not allowed, either the old one MUST be deprecated or the new one MUST be rejected. See also point 13 under &quot;Requirements on the Submitted Document&quot;.</li>

              <li>Who should use it?</li>

            <p>Transition from &quot;Initial&quot; to &quot;Current&quot;</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Starting from the initial submission, each binding has to demonstrate a certain level of concrete development maturity. This process involves real-world testing, which can take place in Plugfests, independent testing events, or even informal collaboration between developers. These testing events do not have to be organized by W3C and can be conducted remotely, including over VPN. The goal is to demonstrate that the binding correctly maps protocol operations and is well understood by at least two parties.</li>
              <li>At each testing event, every operation defined in the binding MUST be validated automatically (e.g., scripts, test suites, etc.) and the results SHOULD be published in a dedicated document (README, or other human-readable documents) called <em>Test Report</em>.</li>
              <li>A <em>Test Report</em><ul>
              <li>MUST contain information on the testing environment</li>
              <li>MUST provide an example of the logical process (not necessarily code) about how a TD can be processed to establish a communication between consumer and exposer.</li>
              <li>MUST contain information about the scenario that was tested, e.g. controlling the room temperature by measuring temperature and adjusting the heater.</li>
              <li>MUST explain where discussions on implementation experience should be collected</li>
              <li>SHOULD provide the history of all the past testing events (or explain how to retrieve the history of the results gathered during those events)</li>
              <li>SHOULD contain a reference to the implementations of Consumers or Exposers.</li>
              </ul>
              </li>
              <li>For the binding to transition to the &quot;Current&quot; state, a <em>Test Report</em> MUST exist. The <em>Test Report</em> MUST contain at least one implementation of a Consumer (capable of understanding and performing all the operations described in the binding) and one Exposer (capable of handling all the operations and features described in the binding and optionally be able to create a valid TD). Additional implementations can be added even after the transition to the Current.</li>
              <li>The exact contents of the Test Report is not decided yet. See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wot-bindings-registry/issues/3">https://github.com/w3c/wot-bindings-registry/issues/3</a></li>
              <li>Submitters MAY call for transition but the custodian can also automatically trigger the process once it is verified that the condition above is reached.</li>
              <li><em>Test Reports</em> and related resources SHOULD be published in a git repository. The repository SHOULD be public and it MUST be accessible to the reviewers and the custodian.</li>
              <li>Collaboration between the custodian, reviewers, and submitters is highly encouraged, ideally through a Plugfest or another structured testing session where different implementations can be evaluated collectively.</li>
